PhotoBagel is all about 1 picture per day.

I won't send you any more emails, unless something goes wrong.

**Nerd Alert**
We look for EXIF data on the photograph to figure out which day you took the photo.
However, most mobile phones don't give us this info, so we just assign it to the day you
emailed it to us.
