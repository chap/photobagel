Ooops. You've already sent us a picture for <%= @photo.taken_at.strftime("%D") %>.

PhotoBagel is all about 1 picture per day.

I went ahead and replaced the old one with the on you just sent. See it here:
<%= photo_url(@user, @photo, :host => 'www.photobagel.com')%>

**NERD ALERT
We look for EXIF data on the photograph to figure out which day you took the photo.
However, most phones don't give us this info, so we just assign it to the day you
emailed it to us.

If you have any questions, or keep having problems let me know.
